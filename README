Procedure to acquire image:

first enter "f1" to go into manual focus mode. The camera will start
to continuously capture every 10ms. (The camera trigger input should
be connected to pin 2)

enter "v0" to put pifoc into one of its limit positions.

alternatively you can check with, e.g. "v10" how the image changes
with defocus.

you make sure you bring pifoc to the maximal position before you use
the "c" (capture) option, e.g. "v100".


entering "c100" will acquire 100 images while slowly counting back the
focus position from 100 down to 1. after setting each new focus
position the arduino waits 20ms for the stage to stabilize.


C    .. aborts current acquisition
t    .. triggers camera once
v<n> .. outputs <n> on the dac (0<= n < 4095)
c<n> .. acquire multiple images and counts n down to 0 (0<= n < 4095)
f<b> .. f0 turns of manual focus mode, f1 turns manual focus mode on (camera is continuously triggered)
